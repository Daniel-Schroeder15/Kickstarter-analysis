# An Analysis on Kickstarter Campaigns
Discovering trends within crowdfunding projects within the United Stated and Great Britain. 
Findings of the mean, median, standard deviation, interquartiles and the interquartile range for the goal amount of the successful and failed campaigns in the United States.
Findings of the mean, median, standard deviation, interquartiles and the interquartile range for the pledged amount of the successful and failed campaigns in the United States.
Based on the results, I would recommend starting a campaign in May or June, with setting a goal of $5,000.00. Have the campaign run for 1 month.

###Challenge

Based on the kickstarter data, I have created a useful table and a couple of charts to help make a decision for running the Fever kickstarter campaign. The table describes the plays outcomes based on their goals. The table shows the number of successful, failed, canceled, and total projects based on the funding goal amount. The chart displays the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects from the table.

Based on the chart:
- The most successful campaigns for plays (or the least likely to fail) were those with the goal of $4,999.00 or less.
- The majority amount of campains for plays fell between the goal amount of $1,000.00 and $4,999.00.

Another chart that I put together displayed the trends between the outcomes based on the launch date.

Based on the chart:
- The most successful time to start a theatre campaign is May and June.
- The least successful time to start a theatre campaign is December. 

Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short period of time. We do not know exactly how long the campaign was going for, and what qualifies as a short period of time. In order to find out how long a play campaign should go on for, it would be best to set up a chart displaying the number of successful and failed outcomes with the Length of time (in Days). It would be reasonable to say that you may have a better shot of receiving the goal amount if the campaign is longer;however, the data may not prove that. In Fact, the success rate is better if you run a campaign for 40 days or less. This may not be the reason why you receive your campaign goal amount, but the data suggests that it is correlated.
